# Employee Repository REST API Using Spring Boot and Mongo DB

## Technology Used

* Java v1.8
* Maven v3.5
* Spring Boot v2.0.4.RELEASE
* Mongo DB v3.6

## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a project built on the top of the Spring framework. It provides a simpler and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications. Before Spring Boot, you need to configure all the dependencies by yourself. Hence, resulting in lot of configuration files, such as XML descriptors. Thatâ€™s one out of the main problems that Spring Boot solves for you. It smartly chooses the dependencies, auto-configures all the features an application needs, and you can start your application with one click. Furthermore, it also simplifies the deployment process of your application.  

## Mongo DB

MongoDB is a [Cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform) [Document-oriented Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) program. It is issued under the [Server Side Public License (SSPL)](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license) version 1, which was submitted for OSI certification but later withdrawn in lieu of SSPL version 2. Classified as a **NoSQL** database program, MongoDB uses [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)-like documents with schemata. MongoDB is developed by [MongoDB Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB_Inc).
